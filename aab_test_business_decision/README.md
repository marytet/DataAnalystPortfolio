## A/A/B Test to Inform Business Decisions

The goal of the project is to investigate user behavior for the application
of the company that sells food products, as well as help the company's managers
in deciding whether to change the design of the app. 
The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old design,
and one test group gets the new ones.
