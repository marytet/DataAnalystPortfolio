## Video Games Market Analysis

I work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. 
User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), 
and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. 
I need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. 
This will allow me to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns; 
imagine that itâ€™s December 2016, and I'm planning a campaign for 2017.

### 1. Total sales analysis and platform analysis
The starting point for analysis will be display and analyze total sales 
across all regions since 1980.

The graph above shows the total sales of video games by release year. 
Since 2001, video game sales have grown rapidly and picked at 2008. 
After 2008 the popularity of video games began to decline, and in 2012-2015
years total sales are approximately $250-350 million per year.

The next step will be identifying the most popular and sold gaming platforms.

This figure shows the total sales of games on each platform. The most 
popular platform for the whole history of video games is the platform PS2.
The highest revenue of video games on this platform reaches more than 
1200 million USD. Next, the most popular platforms are X360, PS3, Wii.

I decided to display the most popular platforms of 2015 and compare the 
total sales on these platforms with total sales of the most profitable 
platforms to get a clear idea of how the sales of video games have changed
(the chart below), and each of the platforms are gaining popularity or 
on the peak of popularity to decide which games on which platforms will 
be the best-selling in 2017.

This graph shows the total sales of the two most popular platforms in 
the history of video games (PS2 and X360) and of the most popular 
platforms in 2015. Total sales of the PS2 are growing rapidly, I believe 
it will also remain the most popular in 2017. Due to the fact that the 
lifecycle of the platform is about 10-12 years and this number is 
decreasing, and that the data for 2016 may be incomplete, I propose 
to consider data from 2011 inclusive. So I identified two platforms 
with the greatest potential in 2017: PS4 and XOne.
