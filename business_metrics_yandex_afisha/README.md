As an intern in the analytical department at Yandex.Afisha. My task is to analyze the business metrics of Yandex.Afisha, an app that helps users find out about events like movie showings, exhibitions, gigs, etc. and buy tickets. My goal is to help marketing experts from Yandex.Afisha make effective investments in marketing, i.e. optimize marketing expenses.
