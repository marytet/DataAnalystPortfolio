# The goal of the project
### Based on analytic data on loan status snapshot DB, analyze loan performance over the time and answer the following questions:
    * What attribute provides the best predictor of late borrowers?
    * Identify additional parameters for determining trends in default rates over time.
    * How has loan size changed over the years? What impact did it have on loan performance?
    * Can you find and explain seasonality in loan performance over the course of a year?
    * You can request an additional data point. Which attribute will you ask for in order to accurately predict the default rate?
