LINK: [project](video_games_sales)

### The goal of the project:
Based on the data about users and expert reviews, genres, platforms, 
and historical data on game sales, identify patterns that determine 
whether the game is successful or not to plan the advertising campaigns 
for online store.
### Skills:
Data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem,
hypothesis testing, data visualization.
### Technologies and libraries:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Plotly.
### Conclusions:
We can see the total annual revenue for console games declining. They were at their peak in 2004, now their popularity is falling. My guess is that this is due to the growing market for mobile video games (or another type of video game that is gaining popularity: virtual reality). Regionally, North America is the largest market (percentage of total games sold over the past five years), followed by Japan. The gaming industry is quite specific, and in the graphs above, we see how strongly the region in which the researched user is located affects. the user profile by region shows us that the CC platform is the most popular in Japan, which is not even included in the top 5 most popular user platforms in America and Europe. For greater success, I propose to divide the purchased types of video games depending on the region where the store is located in accordance with the user profiles that we have compiled. Here are the user's profiles for each region and let's take into account mainly those platforms that are at the peak of popularity or are gaining popularity:

North America. NA has the largest share of the consumer video games market. The most popular platforms in this region are X360, PS3, PS4, Xone, and 3DS. But taking into account the research conducted, I propose to focus on sales on the PS4 and XOne platforms. Here is the list of the most popular genres (in descending order): action, sport, shooter, platform, and misk.

Europe. The preferences of European users of video games do not differ much in terms of genres, the only difference is that the 5 most popular genres in Europe include not platform, but racing. As for the type of platform, we also see only one difference with the NA region: the PC, not the XOne.

Japan. For this region, I propose to promote video games on the PS4 platform, continue selling 3DS, and also two platforms that are popular only in Japan: PSP and PSV. The most popular genre in this region is role-playing, and further in descending order: action, misc, fighting, platform.
