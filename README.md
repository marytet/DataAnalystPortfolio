## Project 5. Trending video analysis on YouTube

LINK: [project](trending_video_analysis)

### Project description
As a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency I devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.

The goal of the project is to develop a dashboard to automatically answer to the next questions:
* Which video categories trended most often?
* How were they distributed among regions?
* What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?

Project includes PowerPoint presentation and link to the developed dashboard in Tableau.

### Technologies: 
PowerPoint, Tableau

## Project 6. Loan analysis

* How has loan size changed over the years? What impact did it have on loan performance?
* Can you find and explain seasonality in loan performance over the course of a year?
* You can request an additional data point. Which attribute will you ask for in order to accurately predict the default rate?
