## A/B Test E-commerce website

I get an analytical task from the international online store to finish the A/B testing based on data received from our predecessors: they launched an A/B test and then quit.

The main goal of the project is to perform and study the results of A/B tests on the statistical significant difference in conversion rate between the control groups based on the data collected by international online store. We will also test the difference in proportions of the number of users at each stage of the event funnel between tested groups and estimate the average order size.

We will use the technical description received from our predecessors and results of their tests. At our disposal data files about marketing events, data on all users, all events of the new users and data on test participants.
