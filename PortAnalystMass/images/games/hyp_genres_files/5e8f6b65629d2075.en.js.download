We'll discuss DOM elements in detail later. By now we'd just say that a DOM element is actually any tag on the page. This has nothing to do with a tag's purpose or the BEM specification.\nJust remember that a BEM element is a logical concept, while a DOM element is a technical one.","web_theme1.4_lesson6_separated_by_a_hyphen":"This is called kebab case. Hyphens form some sort of skewer that holds letters like pieces of meat (or veggies, as you prefer it).","web_theme7.2_lesson5_ES6":"ES6 is the sixth version of the ECMAScript specification introduced in 2015. That's why it's sometimes called ES2015.","web_theme4.2_lesson1_task1_Math":"`Math` is one of the standard built-in objects of JavaScript. We'll examine it in more detail later, but for now, the main thing to note is that the name of this object should always be capitalized.","web_bash_m":"Short for \"message.\"","web_bash_commit":"The phrase \"commit to memory\" describes an effort to remember something exactly as it is. In a similar vein, a Git commit creates a new version of your code. Commits function kind of like little memories.","da_us_python_csv":"\"Comma-separated values,\" a file format. Each line is one row of a table, with data separated by commas.","da_us_free_course1_lesson6_variable":"An object that stores data. By referring to the variable, you access the data currently stored inside it.","da_us_free_course1_lesson8_percentage":"Percentages aren't always whole numbers. If Alex got 33.3% of votes for employee of the month in November, that means one in three of his colleagues voted for him.","web_theme8.1_lesson1_compress":"Developers refer to this process as minification.","web_theme8.5_lesson3_jQuery":"jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes working with the DOM tree easier. While not as popular today as it once was, jQuery is well known for making a lot of common JavaScript functions — like those for handling click events, animations, and so on — easier to write.","web_theme8.5_lesson3_CDN":"Content Delivery Network.","web_theme8.3_lesson2_component":"A module that contains a class.","web_translate_html_DOM":"Document Object Model.","web_theme4.3_lesson1_task4_array":"Technically not an array, but a pseudo-array. We'll talk more about this later.","web_theme8.3_lesson3_visual representation":"When a class has a visual representation, it means it has certain properties and methods that are responsible for visualization and interactivity. Do you remember the `_getTemplate()` and `_setEventListeners()` methods of the `Card` class? These methods interact with markup and event listeners. That's why when speaking of the `Card` class, we say it has a visual representation.","web_theme8.3_lesson3_Validation API":"The validity object along with all its properties and methods.","web_theme8.5_lesson6_module.exports":"This is the first time we've worked with Node.js. In it, the `module` global object is available by default. Its `exports` property indicates what must be exported from a file. We'll use this type of export only in the Webpack config file because this file is executed in Node.js. In all other files, we'll continue using the good old `import` and `export` directives.","web_theme8.5_lesson6_require()":"The `require()` function is the Node.js analog of `import`. Again, we'll use this way of file connection only in Webpack config as this file is executed in Node.js. In all other files, we'll continue using the `import` directive.","web_theme8.5_lesson6___dirname":"The `__dirname` variable in Node.js is available globally. It contains the absolute path to the folder, which stores the file where we used this variable. In our case, the absolute path to the folder with the Webpack config file is our project root.","web_theme8.5_lesson8_create a new `index.html` file":"You can also connect Webpack to an existing project. In this case, move the finished `index.html` file to the `src` folder.","web_theme8.5_lesson11_minification":"Minification means compressing the file size while maintaining all of its functionality. This involves removing comments, spaces, and line breaks from your files. This all makes the file smaller, which means that it loads faster in the user's browser.","web_theme8.5_lesson11_you need to change the means of connecting `css-loader`":"This is explicitly stated in Webpack's documentation.","web_theme8.5_lesson11_must be performed before running `css-loader`":"This is an important point in Webpack's documentation. In short, if you don't pass the `importLoaders` option, PostCSS won't process CSS files that have `@import`. Usually, you'd discover something like this only after hours of reading documentation and threads on StackOverflow. We're explaining this now to save you from any future pain.","web_theme0.5_lesson2_programming_language":"Programming languages allow you to write custom instructions for computers to make them do what you want.","web_theme9.2_lesson6_jQuery":"A JavaScript library that used to be very popular for interface development. While some teams still use it today, it's mostly been replaced by newer technologies, so we won't cover it in this program.","web_theme9.2_lesson6_usually with one parameter":"`then()` actually takes two optional parameters: the first one to handle the fulfilled promise, the second one to handle the rejected promise. However, it's more common to use `catch()` to handle errors and exceptions.","web_lingo_throttling":"Throttling is the intentional slowing down of internet speed. It's often used to test how a site behaves on low bandwidth.","web_theme9.5_lesson1_v1":"Most APIs evolve over time. In the future, we may somehow modify the project API. For example, we may change the structure of a request. But one doesn't simply make such modifications as changing requests can cause issues with the functionality that depends on that request.\n\nTo prevent this, developers have agreed to specify the API version by writing it in the API address. `v1` means the first version of the API. When something is modified or changed in an API, the version can change to v2, and be updated along these lines as new changes continue to come along. However, your code's server requests will continue functioning as before, as they have their version explicitly indicated and will know to use the first version of the API. This standard ensures application stability.","web_theme0.6_lesson4_declare":"You can also say \"create a function,\" but web developers say \"declare.\"","web_theme4.3_lesson1_task1_Math":"`Math` is one of the standard built-in objects of JavaScript.

For example, we could write the code for our JSX in pure JavaScript, but the syntax is unruly and can be difficult to work with.","web_theme10.2_lesson6_the map() array method":"The `map()` method creates a new array based on an existing one. Inside this method's callback, we describe transformations that will be applied to each element of the array.","web_react_props":"Shorthand for \"properties\".","web_theme10.2_lesson8_React_engine":"By the way, sometimes when we talk about React, we'll use the term \"engine\" whenever we're speaking about the internal processes of the actual React.js library. At the same time, we also use the term React when describing the general principles, approaches, and development methodologies that are built around this library.","web_theme10.3_lesson2_optimized_build":"The code that we use in the production version of our application can be quite different. For example, there are a number of development tools that we use in our project that won't need to be included in the final code. Additionally, our code can be minified, compressed, and assembled to ensure better overall performance.","web_react_presentational_components":"These React components are only responsible for rendering data in the\nbrowser, meaning that they are primarily concerned with the visual look\nof the application. They are usually supplemented with container\ncomponents that are responsible for loading and processing data.","web_js_assets":"In terms of web design and development, this term typically refers to the text content, pictures, graphics, video and audio files, and databases.","web_theme10.5_lesson2_prompt":"The `prompt()` function, much like the `alert()` function, will show users a dialog box containing whatever message we pass to the function. In addition, `prompt()` also allows you to receive some data back from the user, which will be returned by the function, so we can use it in our code. This data will be a string, so if we need to change it to a number type, we can pass the value from `prompt()` to the `Number()` function.\n\nIn real projects, developers really don't make much use of `prompt()`. We're only bringing it up for educational purposes.","web_theme9.5_lesson1_dist":"If you have a build folder with a different name in your project, replace `dist` with this name.","web_js_options_object":"This is a normal JavaScript object that contains a set of named parameters that are passed into a function.

Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion.","da_us_general_duplicate":"Rows that contain the same information as other rows. Duplicates can be exact and partial. There might also be duplicates where the same data is presented, but in a different form (for instance, the same numbers are given, but as words rather than digits).","da_us_general_export":"Exporting means downloading data needed for analysis or for making a decision. Data is generally exported as tables.","da_us_general_histogram":"A graph showing the frequency with which values appear in a dataset.","da_us_general_index":"The unique identifier of a particular row.","da_us_general_IQR":"Interquartile range, a measure of dispersion.

Floating-point numbers usually have a decimal point.","web_theme5.1_lesson8_radix":"A radix is the base of a numeral system. We all use the decimal system in our everyday lives, which has a base of `10`, because it has `10` digits ranging from `0` to `9`. In this case, we would say that the radix of our numeral system is `10`.  The radix of the numeral system tells you how many characters there are to represent numbers. The binary system, for example has a radix of 2, because you can only represent numbers in terms of `0` and `1`. Other common numeral systems in programming include octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16).","da_us_general_variable":"A collection of ready-made functions and methods that you can use in your code.","web_theme1.7_lesson1_file_extensions":"**Fact attack!**\n\nSome operational systems don't require a file to have an extension and \nrather store all the important information inside the file. \nAlthough a user can't directly open a file with no extension, the \nprogram that made it will be able to read it.","web_theme1.6_lesson5_unix_path_notation":"A universal notation that's also used in UNIX-based systems.
